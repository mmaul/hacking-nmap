    "# Hacking with nmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets have some fun with nmap...\n",
    "\n",
    "First some conventions, this notebook is using a Jupyter Notepook with an Python Kernel though most of the stuff we will be doing are bash commands. The Jupyter Puthon Kernel allows running of bash commands by prepending a exclemation point in front of the command or by prepending a code block with %%bash, so that is why there is a bang in fron of bash commands or %%bash in code blocks with bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is nmap, nmap is a flexible, extensible network scanning engine. Without even touching on the extensible bits nmap contains many sophisticated useful features. The extensibility parts makes nmap a more powerful scanning enging but extends it's capabilities in to the realm of vulnerability scanning, network toolkits and exploit delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right so first thing is RTFM which on UNIX systems is the venerable manpage.\n",

    "NAME\n",
    "       nmap - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner\n",

    "SYNOPSIS\n",
    "       nmap [Scan Type...] [Options] {target specification}\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration\n",
    "       and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,\n",
    "       although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets\n",
    "       in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,\n",
    "       what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,\n",
    "       what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of\n",
    "       packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other\n",
    "       ...\n",

    "BTW about the command we just ran to dumpt the man pate into the note book, well the the -P option tells man to use formattting like cat would and just dump the page instead of paginating it for a terminsl.\n",
    "\n",
    "What a wall of text, well with great flexibility comes great complexity.. But who reads man pages anyways, your question is probably on Stackoverflow already/... ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seriously though man pages are a tremendous resource, and prehaps a value lost in today's world of Aglie development.\n",
    "\n",
    "So ther is a lot of information about nmap out there and if your familiar with nmap and nse you might as well as stop reading now. The main objective here is to hack with something that is new and unfamilar. It is imposible to know everything about everything, however with a the right analytical skills today especially it give you the tools to travel light and get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I wanted to focus on here is the extensibility aspect, in that I am refering to NSE the nmap scripting engine...\n",
    "\n",
    "NMap comes with a number of scrpts utilizing NSE lets take a look at one real quick...But it might help if we did this with a purpose in mind....\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets supose we thought that developers might be using the builtin Python http-server module for development and that they are doing it in their development directory which is a git repository, they could be exposing credentials that would allow injection of malicious code in to a souce tree that could make it in to production, what a nice place to put a backdoor....\n",
    "\n",
    "Right so how do we do this? Youre vaugly familiar with nmap, it's a port scanner that would be good for perhaps scanning for ports that have a HTTP server running. But how do we know if the server is a Python http-server? So dorking about with nmap and browsing on the interwebs you find out about this cool feature of nmap that allows scripting, and that there a lot of built in scripts in /usr/share/nmap/scripts . There is even one called http-headers that prints out HTTP headers of any HTTP server that nmap connects to\n",
    "This one dumps the banner output from an number of network protocols....\n",
    "\n",
    "Looks like a good start and it'ts easy enough to stand up a Python http-server inside a directory with a git repo to test our theory...."
