    "# Hacking Nmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets have some fun with nmap...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Prelude\n",
    "This document is a Jupyter Notebook running Python Kernel, if you wish to run this notebook you will need to install Jupyter, Python3 and Nmap. Some commands are Unix specific so you may need to do a bit of translation if your running under Windows. The Jupyter Puthon Kernel allows running of bash commands by prepending a exclemation point (!) in front of the command or by prepending a code block with %%bash, so if your just following along in a lowly terminal dont include those when you copy and paste.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Nmap is a flexible, extensible network scanning engine. Without even touching on the extensible bits nmap contains many sophisticated useful features. The extensibility parts make nmap a eve more powerful scanning enging but extends it's capabilities in to the realm of vulnerability scanning, network toolkits and exploit delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right so first thing is RTFM which on UNIX systems is the venerable manpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "man nmap\n",

    "NMAP(1)                      Nmap Reference Guide                      NMAP(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "NAME\n",
    "       nmap - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner\n",
    "\n",
    "SYNOPSIS\n",
    "       nmap [Scan Type...] [Options] {target specification}\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration\n",
    "       and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,\n",
    "       although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets\n",
    "       in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,\n",
    "       what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,\n",
    "       what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of\n",
    "       packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't include the whole think because it is really really long. You can get the above by doing ``` man nmap```.\n",
    "You can also find it online at https://linux.die.net/man/1/nmap and more information in the nmap book at https://nmap.org/book/man.html."

    "What a wall of text, well with great flexibility comes great complexity.. But who reads man pages anyways, your question is probably on Stackoverflow already/... ;)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seriously though man pages are a tremendous resource, and prehaps a value lost in today's world of Agile development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ther is a lot of information about Nmap out there and if your familiar with Nmap and nse you might as well as stop reading now (Seriously keep reading because well be talking about scrpting with Nmap and alot of people haven't done that). The main objective here is to hack with something that is new and unfamilar. It is imposible to know everything about everything, however by honing your  analytical skills and intuition; today especially it give you the tools in your toolbox to travel light and get things done.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lets go!!!\n",
    "When I set out to learn something new it helps if I have a purpose real or even contrived, it really helps otherwise I go through a bunch of tutorials and blogs but never end up doing anything with what I'm trying to learn. It just helps it stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is your missions if you choose to accept it:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Lets supose we thought that developers might be using the builtin Python http-server module for development and that they are doing it in their development directory which is a git repository, they could be exposing credentials that would allow injection of malicious code in to a souce tree that could make it in to production, what a nice place to put a backdoor....\n",
    "\n",
    "Right so how do we do this? Youre vaugly familiar with nmap, you heard it is really cool and want an excuse to use it, it's a port scanner that would be good for perhaps scanning for ports that have a HTTP server running. But how do we know if the server is a Python http-server? Then how do we get it to find and collect Git repository information?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dorking about with nmap and browsing on the interwebs we find out about this cool feature of nmap that allows scripting, and that there a lot of built in scripts in ```/usr/share/nmap/scripts```. There is even one called http-headers that prints out HTTP headers of any HTTP server that nmap connects to. Perhaps we can use HTTP headers to determine if we are connected to a Python http-server.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to set up something to test against, it'ts easy enough to stand up a Python http-server inside a directory with a git repo to test our theory...."
