    "First some conventions, this notebook is using a Jupyter Notepook with an Python Kernel though most of the stuff we will be doing are bash commands. The Jupyter Puthon Kernel allows running of bash commands by prepending a exclemation point in front of the command or by prepending a code block with %%bash, so that is why there is a bang in fron of bash commands or %%bash in code blocks with bash commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is nmap, nmap is a flexible, extensible network scanning engine. Without even touching on the extensible bits nmap contains many sophisticated useful features. The extensibility parts makes nmap a more powerful scanning enging but extends it's capabilities in to the realm of vulnerability scanning, network toolkits and exploit delivery.\n",

      "       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration\n",
      "       and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks,\n",
      "       although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets\n",
      "       in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network,\n",
      "       what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering,\n",
      "       what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of\n",
      "       packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other\n",
      "       characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits, many\n",
      "       systems and network administrators find it useful for routine tasks\n",
      "       such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and\n",
      "       monitoring host or service uptime.\n",
      "\n",
      "       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental\n",
      "       information on each depending on the options used. Key among that\n",
      "       information is the “interesting ports table”.  That table lists the\n",
      "       port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is either\n",
      "       open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an application\n",
      "       on the target machine is listening for connections/packets on that\n",
      "       port.  Filtered means that a firewall, filter, or other network\n",
      "       obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is\n",
      "       open or closed.  Closed ports have no application listening on them,\n",
      "       though they could open up at any time. Ports are classified as\n",
      "       unfiltered when they are responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot\n",
      "       determine whether they are open or closed. Nmap reports the state\n",

That is to say new objects are built on top of existing objects which serve as ptototypes adding attributes and methods. There some other syntactic differences.
